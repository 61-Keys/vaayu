    "description": "I'm a recent graduate from NITK Surathkal, currently working as an Integrity Engineer at ExxonMobil in Bengaluru. During the severe Delhi air quality crisis, I found myself questioning a fundamental gap in how we measure air pollution: government AQI readings come from sparse monitoring stations, often kilometers away from where people actually live and breathe. A mother in Koramangala checking the AQI on her phone sees a reading from BTM Layout — but that's not the air her child is breathing at the neighborhood park. This realization sparked Project Vaayu: an open-source, affordable, accurate air quality monitor that anyone can use to know what they're actually breathing, right here, right now. I bring hands-on experience with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and electronics prototyping, combined with access to 3D printing for enclosure development.",

    "description": "Project Vaayu (Sanskrit for 'wind/air') is an open-source hardware initiative to create an affordable (₹5,000 / ~$60 USD) air quality monitoring device that enables hyperlocal AQI measurement anywhere in India.\n\n**The Problem:**\nGovernment CPCB stations are sparse — a city like Bangalore has only a handful of monitors for 13 million people. When you check AQI on your phone, you see the reading from a station that might be 5-10km away. But air quality varies dramatically block-by-block: near a construction site vs. a park, a busy intersection vs. a residential lane. People make health decisions (morning walks, children's outdoor play, opening windows) based on data that doesn't represent their actual air.\n\n**The Solution:**\nVaayu is a portable, USB-C powered device that displays real-time PM2.5 AQI readings. Key features:\n• ±10% accuracy target through environmental correction (humidity/temperature) and auto-calibration against CPCB API\n• No app required — just a clear OLED display showing AQI number and category (Good/Moderate/Unhealthy/etc.)\n• One-time WiFi setup for auto-calibration, then works completely offline\n• Weather-resistant enclosure for outdoor use\n• Fully open-source: hardware designs, firmware, enclosure STL files, and documentation\n\n**Why Open Source Matters:**\nAir pollution is India's largest environmental health threat, reducing life expectancy by 5+ years on average. Making accurate monitoring accessible isn't just a product opportunity — it's a public health imperative. Open-sourcing Vaayu enables community replication, localized improvements, and eventually a crowdsourced hyperlocal air quality network across Indian cities.\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n• Plantower PMS5003 laser particle sensor for PM2.5/PM10 measurement\n• BME280 for temperature/humidity (enables correction algorithms)\n• ESP32-C3 microcontroller with native USB-C and WiFi\n• 0.96\" OLED display for instant AQI readout\n• India-specific correction factors tuned against CPCB reference data\n• Auto-calibration via CPCB public API — no user travel to reference stations required",
