    "description": "I'm a recent graduate from NITK Surathkal, currently working as an Integrity Engineer at ExxonMobil in Bengaluru. During the severe Delhi air quality crisis, I found myself questioning a fundamental gap in how we measure air pollution: government AQI readings come from sparse monitoring stations, often kilometers away from where people actually live and breathe. A mother in Koramangala checking the AQI on her phone sees a reading from BTM Layout — but that's not the air her child is breathing at the neighborhood park. This realization sparked Project Vaayu: an open-source, affordable, accurate air quality monitor that anyone can use to know what they're actually breathing, right here, right now. I bring hands-on experience with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and electronics prototyping, combined with access to 3D printing for enclosure development.",

    "description": "Project Vaayu (Sanskrit for 'wind/air') is an open-source hardware initiative to create an affordable (₹5,000 / ~$60 USD) air quality monitor enabling hyperlocal AQI measurement anywhere in India.\n\n**The Problem:** Government CPCB stations are sparse — Bangalore has only a handful of monitors for 13 million people. Air quality varies dramatically block-by-block, yet people make health decisions based on readings from stations 5-10km away.\n\n**The Solution:** A portable, USB-C powered device displaying real-time PM2.5 AQI:\n• ±10% accuracy via environmental correction + auto-calibration against CPCB API\n• No app required — OLED display shows AQI number and category\n• One-time WiFi setup for calibration, then fully offline\n• Weather-resistant for outdoor use\n• Fully open-source: hardware, firmware, enclosure STLs, documentation\n\n**Why Open Source:** Air pollution reduces Indian life expectancy by 5+ years. Accurate monitoring shouldn't be a privilege. Open-sourcing enables community replication and eventually a crowdsourced hyperlocal air quality network.\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n• Plantower PMS5003 laser particle sensor\n• BME280 for temperature/humidity correction\n• ESP32-C3 with USB-C and WiFi\n• India-specific correction factors tuned against CPCB data\n• Auto-calibration via CPCB public API",
